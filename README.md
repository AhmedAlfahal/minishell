# Minishell Project:

Minishell is a project assigned by the 42 school, which aims to create a simple shell. \
A shell is a program that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands, \
in addittion this project requires the implementation of several features, including:

&nbsp;  • A prompt that displays the current working directory. \
&nbsp;  • Reading and parsing commands entered by the user. \
&nbsp;  • Handling built-in commands (such as cd, echo, and env). \
&nbsp;  • Managing environment variables. \
&nbsp;  • Executing external commands.
